It's week 11 and Letterbox is up and running (finally). We've deployed it to a temporary AWS for people to test it out, but eventually, we'll be launching it as a native app.

Here are some things I've noticed and learnt in the past few weeks:

# Figure out the elevator pitch
When we approached some people to give us feedback about our app, it became evident that we needed a good way to explain our app. Once you mention the words "dating app", people automatically have pre-conceived notions of what it is; "Oh, a dating app? I don't use dating apps", "Oh, a dating app, must be like Tinder".

It's human nature to relate things and form opinions without knowing the full picture. That's what makes pitching challenging.

Furthermore, to be able to explain our app properly, everyone had to be on the same page. To do that, we crafted a short pitch that everyone understood and agreed upon.

Letterbox is a dating app that allows you to meet new people with similar mindsets and opinions of life.

That's not our full elevator pitch, but it captures the essence of Letterbox and what we're striving to create.

# Get to the point
There's also the point about crafting the pitch in a way that answers your questions. For example, just reading the above pitch will likely make you wonder "how"; how can this app help me meet people with similar mindsets?

I think this is what makes or breaks a pitch. If you can't get to the point and answer such unspoken questions quickly, you risk losing the interest of the people you are pitching to. There's no point talking about the specifics of Letterbox (such as the types of would you rather questions) when the other party is still confused about the general idea of Letterbox.

This point can actually be generalised to the skill of being able to step into the other person's shoes while explaining ideas. When explaining concepts to others, it's important to be able to sense if the other person actually gets it. I think it's a skill that can be mastered (and is not confined to pitches).

# Focus, focus, focus
Not much to say here. It takes a lot of discipline to stay focused on doing a single task and not be distracted by anything at all. It's something I'm constantly working on.

That's it for this week. Looking ahead, we will need to fix some UI issues, incorporate "deals" and market our app properly soon. Very soon.

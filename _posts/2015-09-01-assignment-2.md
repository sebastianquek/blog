Twitch is a streaming video service like YouTube but with a focus on the gaming community. Launched in 2011 as a fork of Justin.tv (another generic streaming video service that ultimately shut down), it has risen in popularity exponentially. It's currently owned by Amazon, who acquired it for just shy of a billion dollars in 2014. I was blown away by that figure when it was mentioned in Group 1's presentation. With a community of around 100 million users and 1.5 million broadcasters, Amazon paid around $650 per broadcaster!

Twitch is a very interesting case study of an application. The idea of an interactive community that watches gaming videos together is straightforward. Perhaps the technical details of managing a large user base is much more complex, but in the end, Twitch is really just a video streaming site with a great community. It's really incredible that they managed to amass a massive number of people to contribute to Twitch and make it what it has become.

Group 1 gave us some insights as to why Twitch is so widely successful. Here are some things that I found the most pertinent.

# Great (hooked) community

Twitch has a huge community made up of gamers. I think it's natural for people to want to belong to a community where they can interact, have fun together and perhaps, share inside jokes. The community has created their own memes and jokes where only people within the community know about. Some of these jokes are based on Twitch's custom emoji set. This further perpetuates the growth of the community as it attracts other gamers to join in as they want to understand these inside jokes. Existing users also want to come back to watch new streams from their favourite streamers and keep in the loop of the latest memes.

Group 1 also mentioned that Twitch piggyback-ed on an existing community. They managed to target a niche market where people in this market wanted to not just play games, they wanted to talk about their experiences too. The market was already there, but Twitch fine-tuned their product to serve the needs of their users.

I think one key learning point from this is that we must look at a market and figure out what exactly users want. Twitch has done a great job in doing that. They created a product that serves its users very well, such that they want to keep coming back.

# Great user experience
The barrier of entry to Twitch is also very low, you simply go to their website (or their app) and select a video stream. You can then read the ongoing chat without the need to login. In that sense, Twitch has really optimised the experience for the gaming community; you can just "lurk" and still feel a part of the community.

Twitch utilises a flat and simple design. Its straightforward design ensures that users can start watching streams easily in just a few steps. Furthermore, the main video screen shows what users want to see, the actual streaming video. No unnecessary clutter. If you want to chat, simply swipe from the right of the screen. This side menu also contains a tab where you can see the information of the stream.

Although such hidden menus can be an anti-pattern for designing great user interfaces, I think it's appropriate in the context of the iPad's relatively small screen size, where every inch of it should be used to show what Twitch is famous for; video game streaming. It can however, be said that such design makes it difficult for newcomers to use.

But the thing about Twitch is that gamers want to be a part of its community. Gamers are drawn to it, they will certainly not be put off by a slightly less than optimal positioning of a menu item.

As such, we need to build a product that's intuitive, easy to use and gives the user what he/she wants without any fuss; _if they don't want to login, don't force them to._

# Great user initiated marketing

I'm sure many people in the gaming community (or even the tech community) have heard of "Twitch Plays Pokémon". If you haven't, it's basically the game, Pokémon, being controlled by users of Twitch through the chat system.

One thing to note about this is that it actually isn't a marketing ploy by Twitch (_or is it?_). By providing an amazing platform for gamers, gamers found interesting and unique ways to get people to watch their own streams. This further helped market Twitch as a whole as media outlets reported about it which inadvertently brought more new users into the community.

Although Twitch did not create this marketing campaign, I think if Twitch wanted to market their product, they could have done something similar too. The main point is that we need to think of unique marketing ideas that utilise interesting features of our application. In Twitch's case, the actively utilised chat system was the feature that brought about the mesmerising experiment that is "Twitch Plays Pokémon".

With that said, what Twitch has done is pretty much what a successful product should strive to do, give a select group of users an amazing experience so that they want to keep coming back. Having ingenious marketing campaigns can then further build the community.

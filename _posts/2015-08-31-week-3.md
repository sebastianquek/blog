It's the end of week 3. Last week's lecture, where Zopim gave us a glimpse of their startup journey, was enlightening. They spoke about the many challenges and also their small victories. I really enjoyed Wenxiang's sharing where he spoke a lot about the technical aspects of starting a company. It's not everyday that you get to have a glimpse into the mind of a person who has had the experience of making a largely technical product and the many issues he had to tackle. Things like making informed decisions while moving fast and focusing on making a great product were some of the points he raised.

I think above all the growth hacking and whatnot, creating a product that is cohesive and easy to use is much more important. It will surely take a whole lot more effort when trying to market a less than optimal product. Oftentimes, great design, be it in branding or user interface, is what makes a product stand out from the crowd. It's more so nowadays where we are flooded with many products that try to solve the same problem. We tend to filter them based on their overall packaging and design.

In the context of assignment 1, my role is largely based around that; frontend development and branding.

It hasn't been easy at all.

We decided to use EmberJS with Semantic UI. We haven't had experience in either of those 2 frameworks, but were feeling rather ambitious to try new things. CS3216 is all about learning to learn, _right_?

Well, CS3216 has certainly pushed me to learn how to learn, though probably at the expense of other modules. One key factor that we didn't really give much thought to was whether we have the time to learn new things sufficiently to make a great product. As it turns out, EmberJS took quite a substantial amount of time to figure out; there was a whole lot of magic going on in the background. Trying to get jQuery and Semantic UI to work with EmberJS was equally exhausting.

Furthermore, as we progressed further into development, it became increasingly difficult for other team members to help out with frontend development. We've completed majority of the functions of the backend, but the learning curve of developing our frontend has been becoming increasingly steep. I guess that's the part where our lack of experience has caused us to be pretty short-sighted.

Anyway, I'm excited to see what NUSPaper can become. NUS is really lacking a platform to discover events in NUS. Staying on top of the latest events is also a challenge.

Facebook's newsfeed is a great way to be the in know of NUS events. The way we scroll through our newsfeed and pick what we want to read/see makes it a great avenue to know more about the myriad of events available with little effort. See an event you like on our Facebook page? Simply click on the link to find out more. There's practically no inertia in discovering events.

Here's to surviving another week.

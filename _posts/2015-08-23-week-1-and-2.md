title: Efficiency and the power of dual monitors
---

This is a pretty late post, but here goes.

I bought an extra monitor in March this year. Best. Decision. Ever.

I don't think I'll be able to live without having two 23" screens. It's extremely convenient, you can code in one screen (with multiple windows) and have the other screen dedicated to seeing your changes and googling.

It's more so in CS3216 where efficiency is key. There really isn't time to fumble with coding on a small screen.

Anyway, on the topic of efficiency, assignment 1 has been alright so far. My lack of experience has been quite a challenge though. I've spent many hours trying to figure out how to get things working and running properly. (I recently decided to switch to Ubuntu to make my life a little easier; I'll leave that for another post)

On top of that, the thought of fast approaching deadlines (from all modules) has been pretty nerve wrecking. There have been many times where I felt that reading documentation was a waste of time, and unknowingly (or rather, instinctively), I scanned through them, filling the gaps with my own preconceived opinions on the way the framework/software should work. 

Although 50% of the time, it works every time, this approach is horribly inefficient. There's a high likelihood that your assumptions cause you to make silly decisions that ultimately demand your time to be fixed.

So for the coming weeks, I will be mindful to read the   manuals properly and be more efficient.

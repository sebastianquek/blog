title: Serious ideas

Having listened to Prof Ben's pitch about finally bringing his lonely heart's club to fruition, our final project group decided to take on the challenge to create this "club". We met up with Prof Ben over dinner to discuss the current status of the problem and some of the potential solutions.

One thing that stood out during the meeting was the difficulty in getting more people to be in a relationship. It really isn't a straightforward problem to solve and the complex nature of relationships doesn't make it any easier. Why is it that people are willing but not able to get into relationships? Is it because of the lack of time? Is it because they are socially awkward? Is it because they are not meeting enough new people?

# Serious == Boring?

From the discussion with Prof Ben, our goal is to create a platform where singles, who are serious about dating, can find their significant others. Furthermore, there needs to be some sort of way for users to know that the other party is legit; our app needs to be trustworthy.

There are a multitude of ways to try to tackle the problem. Some are somewhat more "serious" than others - where the app is built to target people who are actively looking for a relationship. There are also ideas that are more fun and casual - where the app is built for people to have fun and perhaps at the same time, meet new people.

Both ends of the spectrum has it's fair share of associated problems. Creating an app that caters for people looking for a serious relationship will cater to a small group of users. This will surely make improving our app difficult (especially in the short timeframe we have) as the lack of feedback will limit our ability to iterate. Furthermore, it's challenging to come up with ideas that are serious yet not boring.

On the other hand, creating an app that's more fun may not accomplish the goals that we've created. People may use it like any other casual dating app out there (eg. Tinder).  

What we really need is a compromise between the two. We need something that's fun yet serious. How fun and how serious? That's for us to deliberate in the coming weeks as we get feedback from users and iterate.

# Advice

Looking back at the past few weeks, we've received a lot of advice from people about how our app should function and some potential problems with our initial idea.

I found that figuring out the appropriate parts from the overwhelming amount of advice was a challenge in itself. Everyone has their own perspective and opinions about how a dating app should work. It's very difficult to cater to everyone's needs, but at the same time, we can't just ignore given advice.

I think one way for us to continue moving forward, and not be caught up with the myriad of ideas, is to focus on our goals and come to decisions based on them.

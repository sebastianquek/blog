title: Looking ahead

Assignments 1 & 2 are done. It has been an exhausting first 4 weeks of my 3rd sem, but it has been extremely fruitful. I've certainly leveled up my frontend skills as a result of handling majority of the user interface of NUSPaper. It's not perfect, but I'm proud of it.

Looking back, assignment 1 has been an interesting uphill battle.

---

I was unsure about how the group dynamic would be like (having joined Sharon, Haritha and Nathan who knew each other beforehand). Will they be receptive to my ideas? Will I be a burden to the team? Will we be able to make group decisions?

When we first met as a group after the first workshop, I was relieved that my worries were just that, worries. We were able to communicate well, brainstorming for the afternoon and were able to decide as a group to not pursue some of the ideas we had.

# Ideation
We took a long time to figure out an idea that we felt was worthy; other groups had already started. Together with our lack of web development experience, I was pretty anxious and wanted to start as soon as possible. In the end, we started on the 19th of August, just 6 days away from the first review.

As I'm comfortable with designing and creating graphical assets, I created several mockups and drafted the branding of NUSPaper. The mockups helped to ensure everyone was on the same page and to visualise the final vision of our project.

We weren't sure what our stack should be like. Our backend uses Python which almost all of us knew. I suggested to use EmberJS to handle the frontend of NUSPaper as it was something I wanted to learn. I spent the next few days figuring out how to use EmberJS together with Semantic UI. It was difficult, to say the least. The documentation of EmberJS is good, but they recently updated to version 2 and as a result, a lot of articles online are outdated.

# Review cycle 1
When the first demo came around, we didn't have much of a product and had issues with the teaching staff being able to access the page. Ultimately, we did not have much of a first review, other than that our colour scheme was nice. :D

As workload piled up, I was slowly starting to feel burned out. Practically every day was spent on cs3216 and sleeping close to 2am became the norm. It didn't help that no one knew EmberJS, though I'd like to thank Nathan for not giving up on it even when things got very tough.

# Colin's email
It was _scary_. We were indeed way behind the curve and we wanted to stop being screwed.

# Review cycle 2
Well, when review cycle 2 came around, we had a working product and I was eagerly waiting for comments on it. There was still time to improve before the grading on the Friday of that week.

*DING*, an email from Colin arrived. My heart sank when I read it. Colin still couldn't access our app. I was afraid that we wouldn't get a full review. And although I kind of like _living on the edge_, now really wasn't the time for that.

Luckily, it was quickly resolved and we had a better idea of how to improve NUSPaper. NUSPaper was still quite rough at that time, we had some hiccups with deployment that resulted with some parts of the app not working.

All in all, it was good to know that our app was alright.

# Review cycle 3
As the backend was largely completed, It was down to the frontend to connect everything together nicely. I'm quite fortunate to have a free day on Tuesday, which I spent fixing and improving our app. We deployed at around 2am on the day of the last review cycle.

What really made my day was when Colin posted on Facebook about NUSPaper. Thank you Colin!

# Final submission
We improved and finalised some features for NUSPaper and met at around 7pm, around 5 hours from the deadline (yes, we were living on the very edge). To my horror, we realised that there were still some bugs. As Nathan and I frantically fixed some of these bugs, Haritha and Sharon were finalising the report.

It was nerve-racking and I think many profanities were passed.

Ultimately, we managed to complete everything on time, albeit a little to close for comfort.

In the end, I'm very grateful for being a part of this team, every meeting was productive yet fun and we managed to finish what we set out to do; make a better event discovery app for NUS.

Looking forward, assignment 3 has been very slow (finding good ideas is hard), but I'm excited to see what we'll eventually make.

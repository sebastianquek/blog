Week 5 has been hectic with assignment 3 in full gear. The internal pitching session reinforced the notion that asking "why" is a good way to figure out if an idea is worth pursuing. In many circumstances, not being able to clearly explain why a product is needed typically indicates that you either have to refine your idea or it's time to move on.

We finalised our assignment 3 idea after spending practically the whole Tuesday in school. I'm glad that we managed to come up with something we believe in. I think it's extremely crucial that everyone in the team believes in the product so that everyone will have the will and desire to create a great product.

I think we have progressed quite a bit in the past week. Our workflow has been rather quick as our team consists of 4 programmers (with me being the designer as well). I'm handling the branding and frontend design of our product, relive. Relive is an app that allows you to search for events and experience them again. It retrieves data from Twitter and Instagram to show you what happened in that event.

Forming the branding of products is always challenging. You want something that represents your product and something that is recognisable. Furthermore, you want to use a colour scheme that is different from other similar apps and one that doesn't remind you of an existing brand.

When thinking of what to represent relive, I wanted to show something that's related to some form of stored media. Cassettes and discs came to mind, but they don't really encompass the idea of being able to relive events. I had an idea of a toy I once had where you looked into it to see pictures, and pressing a knob will allow you to switch pictures. But I couldn't recall the name of it (neither could I figure out what to ask Google).

And our logo was born! It's still an early draft, but I hope it's recognisable (Around 50% of my friends knew what it was).

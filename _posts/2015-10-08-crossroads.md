Much has happened in the past few days. Monday's lecture was insightful, Wednesday's UI/UX discussion with Colin and Su Yuen was rather enlightening and today's "external" meeting was very fruitful.

I appreciate Laurence Putra's effort to discuss about the monetization options for all the various final projects. For Letterbox, it was largely about placing limits on users and to bypass these limits, they will need to pay. I think this idea is indeed plausible. We're still in the midst of modifying our idea and monetization is very lower on our priority list right now; It's good to have, but not important.

I thoroughly enjoyed the talk by Hugh Anderson. I admire his excitement and enthusiasm for teaching even after so many years of teaching. He made the idea of hashing and the improbability of brute force attacks very easy to understand. His demonstrations and explanations about Heartbleed and Shellshock were superb and his subtitled videos were hilarious. I'd love to take CS3235 under him!

After the talks, we discussed about the doubts we had with our idea. We've spent a lot of time deliberating on the feasibility of our ideas. Here's what Letterbox was about. You can view others' profile question and send a letter to reply that question. The recipient will only be able to open the letter if he/she sends a letter replying to the sender's profile question. Only after all that, the two of you can chat if you both "approve" of each other's answer. Everything's anonymous too.

Yes, if you didn't really get it, I understand, it's pretty hard to explain and probably even harder to get people on board.

One huge question that has been present in our recent discussions was whether people would use it. It doesn't help that we ourselves won't use it (haha). On top of that, there's the challenge of trying to make it "serious" yet not boring. I think it's incredibly difficult to get people to use your app (let alone try your app) if it isn't fun. There must be something that makes your app unique and "replayable".

As we discussed, Colin came over and tried to talk us into Tindon again. I think it's a great idea, but I find that it's more of a secondary aspect of our app - users shouldn't use our app to find deals. Colin also mentioned about how our idea just isn't viable; why would users want to use a rather boring app? At that moment, I somehow had a eureka moment - what if we get users to answer "Would you rather" questions instead of typing out long replies? It's quick, easy and painless; albeit more difficult for users to start chatting. It'll be quite fun as each person you see on the app will likely have a different set of questions. On top of that, it's unlike Tinder where you basically match with someone else purely on whether you both "like" each other. Our app will notify you of people who've answered your questions correctly (maybe 4/5 questions?) and you can start chats with them.

We further deliberated and realised that incorporating deals could be a feasible idea as people who've started chatting on our app may want to take it to the next level. They may not know where to go out to and what to do there. Our app aims to not only connect people, but encourage them to meet up physically i.e to have a date.

Much has happened in the UI/UX discussion and "external" meeting, so I'll leave that for another blog post.

We were at a crossroad, we knew we had to change our path but just weren't sure which direction to go. I'm glad we've decided the path from here and I'm extremely excited to see what we will make of it.
